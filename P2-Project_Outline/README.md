## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My project will be a food allergy tracker. As a mom with a toddler with multiple serious food allergies (eggs, milk, peanuts,
tree nuts, peas), starting to introduce new foods is stressful and takes a lot of planning and preparation. My app will allow users
to enter ingredients in foods that are introduced and flag those ingredients if a reaction occurs. After ingredients are flagged a
specified number of times, that ingredient will come up as high risk. It will allow users to know whether or not to try a new food
by the ingredients as well as track potential new allergens.
